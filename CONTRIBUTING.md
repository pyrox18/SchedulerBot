# Contributing Guidelines

If you would like to contribute to the repository, there are a few things you could do.

## Reporting issues or suggesting features

Feel free to open a new issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/pyrox18/SchedulerBot/issues) if you would like to report a bug or suggest something new for the bot. Just make sure that nobody else has suggested it before.

## Directly modifying the source code

If you're interested in making changes to the code yourself, fork the repository and make the changes on your fork. Then, open a pull request targeting the dev branch (**NOT** the master branch) with some details about the changes that you have made.

### General Guidelines

- [Standard Git commit message conventions](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) apply. Please adhere to these conventions.
- Pull requests should always target the dev branch, and not the master branch.
- Check the dev branch first to see if someone else had already made the same changes that you want to make.
